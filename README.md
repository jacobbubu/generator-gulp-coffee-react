# generator-gulp-coffee-react

Generate a boilerplate project using gulp, coffee-script and react.

## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. You only have to install it once.

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

To install generator-gulp-coffee-react from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-gulp-coffee-react
```

And then, create a directory to put you framer project in:

```bash
$ mkdir your-proj && cd $_
```

After that, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo gulp-coffee-react
```

This step takes time to install all dependencies that your project needs.

Finally, run `npm start` to start your development server and see the demo project.

I'm using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) for code bundling and [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io) for the development web server.
